# MalaysiaHousePrice_Dashboard

This project is a group endeavor for SQIT3073 Business Analytics in Programming at Universiti Utara Malaysia.

This dashboard consists of three pages. The first page contains related information. The second page is Exploratory Data Analysis, consisting of several charts that offer useful insights. The third page is the House Price Estimator, enabling users to predict the price of a house. This predictive dashboard deploys Random Forest for making predictions. The predictions are also evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and R-Squared (R2)."
